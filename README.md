# bartender
Every week we lose time over our weekly session organization :
 - who's going to be present ?
 - what characters availables ?
 - what levels are OK for everyone ?
 - does this character has something special, the DM should know about ?

This software intends to fix all that in a KISS way.

This is based on django 1.7 for now.

This project is more of a django discovery project for me.

Bartender uses the django.contrib.auth module/middlewares for the user parts.
